# AI Quizzer API

This is a Node.js server that provides an AI-powered quiz generation and evaluation system. It allows users to authenticate, generate quizzes, submit answers, view their quiz history, retry quizzes, and retrieve hints for specific questions.

Implemented RATE_LIMITING for Limited access to the server.

Used AWS Amazon Elastic Registry(for Docker image repositories) and EC2 to deploy this application.

Redis is utilized for caching, which significantly reduces latency during quiz generation and evaluation processes. 

Upon submitting their responses, users receive an EMAIL with personalized suggestions for improvement, fostering a more engaging and supportive learning experience.

Used JWT tokens for authentication.
